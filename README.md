# EmployeeManagement

My first java development project, updated with all my learnings as I learn more.

This is an employee management application for:
1. Adding and editing employee details
2. Maintaining employee performance
3. REST services for all operations
4. Using Spring MVC framework
5. SQLite database with Xerial and ORMLite
6. Quartz scheduler for scheduled daily reports
7. Apache VelocityEngine for properly formatted emails
8. JasperReport for .pdf, .xls and .html reports
9. Using Maven for dependencies management and builds
10. Using Jenkins for automated deployment
